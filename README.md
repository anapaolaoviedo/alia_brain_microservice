# ðŸ¤– ALIA Core Microservice

## Overview

ALIA is a hybrid intelligent agent system designed from first principles to combine rule-based safety with adaptive learning policies. Its architecture supports robust, compliant decision-making and future learning enhancements, enabling a balance between deterministic guardrails and flexible intelligence.

This repository contains the core microservice implementation of ALIA, built with FastAPI and modular components designed for scalability, transparency, and scientific rigor.

## ðŸ§  Core Capabilities

### 1. Advanced Orchestration & Decision Logic
- Combines explicit rule-based constraints with a learning-based policy module (Ï€).
- Supports flow control: accept, modify, fallback, or escalate actions.

### 2. Rule-based Safety Engine
- Enforces strict compliance, correctness, and prevents hallucinations.
- Serves as a "guardian" before accepting policy suggestions.

### 3. Hybrid Learning Policy Module
- Suggests adaptive actions using a learned policy model (`policy_model.pkl`).
- Prepares for continuous improvement using logs and future reward signals.

### 4. NLP Processing & Intent Understanding
- Preprocesses input using spaCy, scikit-learn, or DistilBERT.
- Extracts intents and entities to inform decision-making.

### 5. Contextual Memory Management
- Stores and updates user sessions (using Redis or in-memory structures).
- Enables coherent, multi-turn interactions.

### 6. Reward & Feedback Pipeline (Future)
- Supports reward signal logging and future reinforcement learning fine-tuning.

### 7. Modular, Scalable Microservice Architecture
- FastAPI entry point and fully decoupled modules.
- Designed for easy maintenance and future feature expansion.

### 8. Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring
- Tracks user interactions, system decisions, and policy choices.
- Enables detailed audits and data-driven insights.

### 9. Strong Documentation & Team Enablement
- Includes design notes, architecture diagrams, and clear module structure.
- Facilitates smooth knowledge transfer and onboarding.
