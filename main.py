BRAIN - AI Assistant API Server
===============================

This is the main FastAPI server for BRAIN, an AI system inspired by human brain architecture.
BRAIN provides three core capabilities:
1. Advanced Perception - Accurately understands customer messages and intent
2. Memory and Context - Maintains conversation context across multiple interactions  
3. Strategic Decision-Making - Makes rule-based decisions for business actions

This server handles incoming webhook messages and will route them through BRAIN's
processing pipeline once fully integrated.
